#Instructions
10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
emailtext = dict()

for line in handle :
   if line.startswith("From "):
    hour = line.split()[5].split(':')[0] 
    emailtext[hour] = emailtext.get(hour, 0) + 1
    
lst = list()
for key, val in emailtext.items() :
	lst.append ( (val,key) )
	
lst.sort(reverse=True)

for key, value in sorted(emailtext.items(), None):
    print key, value
